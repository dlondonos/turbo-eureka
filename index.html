    <h1>Change Proposal: Driver Payments to Beat</h1>
    <h2>Background:</h2>

  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      One of the main reasons for drivers to visit the driver center regarding payments to Beat are because they have paid but do not see their payment reflected in the app balance. <br>
      In these cases, the representative must ask for the payment voucher, which contains all the information required in order to match the payment with the account.<br>
      Some payments may take up to 3 business days to be reflected in app balance, if 3 business days have not passed, no process is required.<br>
      The representative must then compare with the pending payments which are available on an online payment spreadsheet, if they find the corresponding payment, it must be entered on an “unmatched” spreadsheet which will assign the money to the HQ profile.<br>
      It is also possible that the payment is not found on the spreadsheet, which then means the representative must consult directly with the finance department to check if the payment was cleared successfully by the bank.<br>
      If the payment was cleared and was not found in the online payment spreadsheet, the representative must input the information on the “unmatched” spreadsheet. When the payment is not cleared by the bank, this means that the money was not transferred successfully and the money will not be added to the HQ profile.<br>
    </p>


    <h2>Proposal:</h2>

    <p>
      <b>What:</b><br>
      Change the way we record information into the online payment spreadsheet. <br>
      <b>Why:</b><br>
      The process of matching payments is time consuming and sensitive, as it deals with driver’s money, any mistakes may lead to incorrect or lack of payments and will generate discomfort. <br> As it stands, the payment file is editable, meaning anyone can alter the content, this leads to incorrect information, missing information or correct information being altered. <br>  By changing the way information is entered, the finance team will have full control over the database making it easier for them to address these payments. <br>  Additionally, the information recorded can be of use for the finance team in identifying possible error trends.<br>
      <b>How:</b><br>
      By recording unmatched payment information into a form instead of manually changing the cells on a spreadsheet, editing access to only the finance team to avoid the altering of information. <br>  All Beat members will be able to view the file to access its information but will not be able to perform changes.
